# Mercury Protocol Data DAO smart contracts

A data DAO is a union of data owners who pool their data together and monetize it collectively on the Mercury Data Marketplace.
These smart contracts are deployed on the Filecoin Virtual Machine. The data DAO smart contract directly interacts with the FEVM and allows the data DAO to pay for storage deals.

The Data DAO factory smart contract makes it easy and cost efficient to deploy new data DAOs.

TODO:
- proposals & voting mechanisms (governor-style)
- perpetual storage deals
- staking FIL or MCY in well-performing data DAOs (more on this in our [whitepaper](https://mercuryprotocol.io/mercury-whitepaper.pdf))
